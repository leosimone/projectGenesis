 Since I don't know who is going to evaluate my project, I'll write the readme in english.

 First of all, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hiring proccess. The project is perfectly consistent with what
 talked during my first interview with Ms. Chung.

To start the project I used the "Live Server" extension in VSCode, which is very useful and enabled me to install less dependecies
in the project. Use the command "yarn" to download all the dependencies needed.

Difficulties faced:
This project took me out of my confort zone for a few days. I wasn't dealing with front-end for quite a while, specially without any frameworks, so I had to
remember some aspects of the technology. I didn't managed my days very well, spent too much time tryng to fetch and create
a table that was getting and storing the informations correctly, what led me to have very few time with functions and styling.
I decided to deliver my project, in the correct deadline, without some requirements (such as tests) instead of asking more time.

I do know that this is not my best product, but considering the difficulties I'm ok.
